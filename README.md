# Typer
A little typer I made where you can see how fast you type and choose between phrases

You have to turn on the node.js server inside the server folder to run it

In the "servidor" folder run
```
npm start
```
or
```
yarn start
```

Then you can access the site at http://localhost:3000/index.html

Good game.
